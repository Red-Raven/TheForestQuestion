TheForestQuestion
=================

A Java-based text game engine.
This is a project for me to learn a bit and make something cool.
The Forest Question is the name of the first game I want to write for the engine. I will be writing it as I write the engine as a test case. The games will be written in .txt files to make writing games and modifying them easy.
