TheForestQuestion
=================

A Java-based text game engine.
This is a project for me to learn a bit and make something cool.
The Forest Question is the name of the first game I want to write for the engine. I will be writing it as I write the engine as a test case. The games will be written in .txt files to make writing games and modifying them easy.

I am writing it without .txt support at the moment. All testing will be done by creating objects in the MainClass. Once I learn a bit more about reading and writing to files I will implement it. I tried it once and it got messy very quickly.
